# AudioSpectrograph

A real-time audio spectrum analyzer for Android that provides both traditional FFT and waterfall display modes. This application visualizes audio input from your device's microphone as a frequency spectrum, useful for audio analysis, music visualization, and educational purposes.

## Features

- Real-time audio spectrum analysis
- Two visualization modes:
  - Traditional FFT bar graph display
  - Waterfall spectrogram display
- Adjustable frequency range selection
- Multiple color schemes:
  - Blue to Red (classic spectrum)
  - Black to Purple to Red
- Smooth, efficient rendering optimized for Android
- Configurable display parameters

## Requirements

- Android Studio Arctic Fox or newer
- Android SDK 21 or higher (Android 5.0+)
- Device with microphone support
- Android device with RECORD_AUDIO permission

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ctracy/AudioSpectrograph.git
```

2. Open the project in Android Studio
3. Sync project with Gradle files
4. Build and run on your Android device

## Usage

1. Launch the app
2. Grant microphone permissions when prompted
3. The app will begin displaying the audio spectrum immediately
4. Use the interface buttons to:
   - Toggle between FFT and Waterfall modes
   - Adjust the frequency range
   - Change color schemes

## Controls

- **Toggle Button**: Switch between FFT and Waterfall display modes
- **Frequency Range**: Adjust the visible frequency spectrum
- **Color Scheme**: Toggle between different visualization color patterns

## Technical Details

- Uses Android's AudioRecord API for audio capture
- Implements Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for frequency analysis
- Custom View implementation for efficient rendering
- Supports both regular and waterfall spectrograms
- Thread-safe audio processing and visualization

## Permissions

The app requires the following permission:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
```

## Building from Source

1. Open the project in Android Studio
2. Ensure all dependencies are properly synced
3. Build the project (Build â†’ Make Project)
4. Run on an Android device or emulator
